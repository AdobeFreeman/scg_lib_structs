# scg_lib_structs
Collections of library structure and sequence of popular single cell genomic methods

## Motivation

I was a little bit bombarded with all the single cell methods and got completely lost. To help with myself understand all of them and future troubleshooting, I start to perform an on-paper library preparation whenever I see a new single cell method.

## Why bother?

Here I borrow from Feyman:

**What I cannot create on paper, I do not understand. Know how to re-construct every library that has been invented.**
