# scg_lib_structs
Collections of library structure and sequence of popular single cell genomic methods

## Motivation

I was a little bit bombarded with all the single cell methods and got completely lost. To help with mysefl understand all of them and future troubleshooting, I start to perform a *in silico* library preparation whenever I see a new single cell method.

## Why bother?

If I cannot re-construct the library on paper, I don't understand it.
